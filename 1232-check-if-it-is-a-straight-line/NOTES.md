**Even though checking slope of each points makes sense where slope should be same for any two points. But while slope for consecutive two points the code where points form sqaure(edge case) will fail. Hence, check Collinearity of 3 points.
To check collinearity, check the area of triangle formed using 3 points should be zero.
Formula: x1(y2-y3)+x2(y3-y1)+x3(y1-y2) = 0**
