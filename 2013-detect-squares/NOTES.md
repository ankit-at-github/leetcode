1. Detecting Sqaure: Using Diagonal coordinates: Height difference of y = Height difference of x
2. if two points are known (x,y) and (qx,qy), what will be other points: (x,qy) and (qx, y)
3. How many squares? coordinate1 found * coordinates2 found
​
if any of the coordinate not found product will be zero.
​
return total sum;
